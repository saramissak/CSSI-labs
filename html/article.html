    <h4 id="authorName">By: Sara Missak</h4>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a girl named Sara Missak. She did not like to do much except sleep. Sleep allowed her to destress from life. It allowed her to rest and devule into sweet dreams where she could imagine whatever she liked. She could imagine she was on the beach or in an arcade or even in her very own kitchen eats. Sara could imagine herself on a rocketship flying to Mars or to Saturn's rings. <img src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/S/q/i/b/L/r/chucky-saturn.svg" alt="saturn" width=20px height=10px></p>
    <p>Sleep allows you to dream on and imagine what you would like to be in life. It lets you imagine the impossible and ways to bring it to life. It allows you to strive for what you may not have imagined could happen. Dream on and imagine the best.</p>
